# HOPE
A new approach termed as homologous 3’ extension mediated prime editor (HOPE). HOPE utilizes paired prime editing guide RNAs (pegRNAs) encoding the same edits in both sense and antisense DNA strands to achieve high editing efficiency in  human HEK293T cells as well as mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient HCT116 cells
